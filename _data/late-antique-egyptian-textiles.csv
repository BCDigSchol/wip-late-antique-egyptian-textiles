His first labor was to kill the Nemean Lion, a near invincible beast that no human could slay. This stunning red tapestry square depicts a beared man who appears to be Heracles encountering a lion, perhaps the Nemean Lion itself. A female figure, possibly Omphale, Hippolyta, or Hera herself, observes from the center-left of the composition. Four smaller lions surround the central circle, enhancing the composition’s association with leonine pride and strength.  </br> </br>

Lions carried many meanings in late antiquity. In Jewish scriptures, King David was said to have killed a lion (1 Samuel 17:36) and the prophet Daniel was famously thrown into a lions’ den (Daniel 6). In early medieval Bibles, lions came to most commonly symbolize the evangelist Mark. Leonine motifs are also common in later Islamic art. Regardless of who exactly the central figures are, it is likely that this tapestry would have been woven in to a tunic. The vivid detail and coloration indicate that, regardless of religious belief, the wearer would have been of an elevated social status.

The evangelist Luke was usually represented by a calf in both early and medieval Christianity, and it is likely that this figure stands in for him. The presence of <i>clavi</i> on tunics tended to illustrate the wearer elevated social status, and the iconography of this band suggests that a wealthy Christian patron would have worn the original garment. </br></br>

Considering the period’s iconographic ambiguity, it is provocative to imagine that this figure harkens back to a nimbed Serapis, while also evoking the haloed Christian evangelist. Apis was the ancient Egyptian bull god who, under later Hellenic and Roman influence, was anthropomorphized and combined with Osiris to become Serapis. Although his cult was banned by Christian leaders in the late fourth century, it is possible that his imagery lived on in the material memory of late antique Egyptians. </br></br>

It is one of two roundels (known as <i>orbiculi</i>) that once decorated a tunic, and its match is apparently in the collections of the Benaki Museum in Athens. </br></br>

This roundel epitomizes the iconographic ambiguity of textiles from this period. The figure’s crown is reminiscent of the crown of Tyche (Fortuna), the Greco-Roman goddess of prosperity and fortune. The garland that surrounds the figure’s head is possibly the laurel leaf, a plant associated not only with the well-known myth of Apollo and Daphne, but also with poetry and the imperial Roman state. The figure stands at the center of what appears to be a red Greek cross, and her head is backed by a golden halo, perhaps indicating some kind of Christian sainthood. Who would have worn this tunic? A Christian? A devotee of Tyche? Someone who believed some amalgamation of faiths? Or did someone of means simply find the imagery artistically compelling, and commission the tunic as a status symbol? </br></br>
